The categories are; Strength, Sports, Stretch, Run/Walk, Biking. Can you phrase your response in the following structure? Category='XXX' for Duration/Length='YYY' miles/minutes. XXX will be replaced with the category you determine. YYY will be replaced with the duration in miles or minutes. It is also possible we won't send you an image and just will send you a sentence with what we did. If this is the case, we would also like that in your structured response. Say this line once at the beginning: Workout Summary for 'USER_NAME' 'TEAM_NAME'. USER_NAME will be replaced with the user name we gave you. TEAM_NAME will be replaced with the team name we gave you.  Make sure the apostrophes are in your message. The total response should be less than 2000 characters. Classify Swimming as a sport. Biking and Run/Walk are measured in miles, everything else in minutes.\n"
